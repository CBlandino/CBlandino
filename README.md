### **About me ✍️**
Hi there 👋 I'm Christopher, the brains behind these repositories. I am a programmer currently studying in Suny at Albany. 
I love to create powerful scripts in Java on what I've learned at Albany. Feel free to explore my projects and even build upon them! ###

### **What I'm currently working on 🔭**
I plan to self-teach cloud development and implement a 3D interactive website on the cloud. 
I'm aiming to learn as much as I can about everything there is to software development so come hang around and we can grow together###
